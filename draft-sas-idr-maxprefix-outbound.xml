                        A BGP speaker MAY support the ability to impose a locally-configured, upper bound on the number of address prefixes the speaker is willing to accept from a neighbor (inbound maximum prefix limit) or send to a neighbor (outbound prefix limit).
                        The limit on the prefixes accepted from a neighbor can be applied before policy processing (Pre-Policy) or after policy processing (Post-Policy).
                        Outbound prefix limits MUST be measured after policy, since the Policy (even a policy of "send all") is run before determining what can be sent.
                        When the upper bound is reached, the speaker, under control of local configuration, either:

                                Discards new address prefixes being sent to the neighbor while maintaining the BGP connection with the neighbor. As these prefixes are discarded and their reachability information is not sent to the neighbor it might lead to inconsistent routing behaviour;

                                The pre-policy limit uses the number of NLRIs per Address Family Identifier (AFI) per Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI) as input into its threshold comparisons.
                                For example, when an operator configures the pre-policy limit for IPv4 Unicast to be 50 on a given EBGP session, and the other BGP speaker announces its 51st IPv4 Unicast NLRI, the session MUST be terminated.

                                An operator MAY configure a BGP speaker to terminate its BGP session with a neighbor when the number of address prefixes to be advertised to that neighbor exceeds a locally configured post-policy upper limit.
                                The BGP speaker then MUST send the neighbor a NOTIFICATION message with the Error Code "Cease" and the Error Subcode "Threshold reached: Maximum Number of Prefixes Sent". Implementations MAY support additional actions.
                                The Hard Cease action is defined in <xref target="RFC8538" />.

                                Reporting when thresholds have been exceeded is an implementation specific consideration, but SHOULD include methods such as Syslog <xref target="RFC5424"/>.
                                By definition, Outbound Maximum Prefix Limits are Post-Policy.

                                The Adj-RIBs-Out stores information selected by the local BGP speaker for advertisement to its neighbors.
                                The routing information stored in the Adj-RIBs-Out will be carried in the local BGP speaker's UPDATE messages and advertised to its neighbors <xref target="RFC4271">Section 3.2</xref>.
                                The Outbound Maximum Prefix Limit uses the number of NLRIs per Address Family Identifier (AFI) per Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI), after application of the Export Policy, as input into its threshold comparisons.
                                For example, when an operator configures the Outbound Maximum Prefix Limit for IPv4 Unicast to be 50 on a given EBGP session, and were about to announce its 51st IPv4 Unicast NLRI to the other BGP speaker as a result of the local export policy, the session MUST be terminated.

                                Outbound Maximum Prefix Limits are useful to help dampen the negative effects of a misconfiguration in local policy.
                                In many cases, it would be more desirable to tear down a BGP session rather than causing or propagating a route leak.

	<section title="Use cases">
	    <t>
		    Egress maximum prefix limits are useful in a variety of cases. Some of those are outlined in this section.
            </t>
		    <section title="Internet use case">
			    <t>
				    In order to prevent the BGP speaker from leaking a full routing table to its neighbor operators should 
				    implement proper routing policy and preferably RFC8212. However, even when implementing both measures 
				    an operator could still (accidentaly) announce more routes than intended. Setting a maximum prefix outbound
				    value prevents this.
			    </t>
		    </section>
		    <section title="CE protection">
			    <t>
				    Residential and many business customers connected to the internet using a 'simple' CPE and connected to a single 
				    Service Provider only needs to accept a single default route and not the full internet table. In order to prevent
				    overloading the CPE Control Plane, maximum outbound limits should be applied on the session on the PE router.
			    </t>
		    </section>
		    <section title="PE-CE BGP session from operator side">
			    <t>
				    -- Change this so it explains that it's extra protection towards the PE so it won't kill the BGP session due to max prefix inbound --
				    Internet providers PE side gateway PE-CE connections would would generally set maximum prefix  to disconnect 
				    if maximum prefix is reached. This is a secondary protection mechanism as the primary is prefix length and AS path checks. 
			    </t>
		    </section>
	</section>

        <section title="Security Considerations">
            <t>
				  Maximum Prefix Limits are an essential tool for routing operations and SHOULD be used to increase stability.  They provide a first-line mechanism to avoid route leaks and to avoid unintended routing suggestions to happen between neighbors.  Implementing this measures is only one of the building blocks you need to provide full security, but it is important to build a modular defense system.
	    </t>
						<t>
							Stability for the routing table is also an important aspect for implementing the measures included in this draft.  Ensuring that neighbors will not receive an amount of routes that would overload their routing platform contributes to the stability of interconnections and of the Internet as a whole.
						</t>
        </section>

        <section title="IANA Considerations">
            <t>
                <!-- TDB, find better names? -->
                This memo requests that IANA assigns a new subcode named "Threshold exceeded: Maximum Number of Prefixes Sent" in the "Cease NOTIFICATION message subcodes" registry under the "Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Parameters" group.
