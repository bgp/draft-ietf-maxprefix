		This document updates <xref target="RFC4271" /> by revising control mechanism which limit the negative impact of <xref target="RFC7908">route leaks</xref> and/or resource exhaustion in Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) implementations.
		While <xref target="RFC4271" /> described methods to tear down BGP sessions or discard UPDATES after certain thresholds are exceeded, some nuances in this specification were missing resulting in inconsistencies between BGP implementations.

                        A BGP speaker MAY support the ability to impose a locally-configured, upper bound on the number of address prefixes the speaker is willing to accept from a neighbor (inbound maximum prefix limit).
                        The limit on the prefixes accepted from a neighbor can be applied before policy processing (Pre-Policy) or after policy processing (Post-Policy).
                        When the upper bound is reached, the speaker, under control of local configuration, either:
                        <list style="letters">

                                Discards new address prefixes from the neighbor, while maintaining the BGP connection.  As these prefixes are discared, their reachability information is not stored on the local router, which might lead to inconsistent routing behaviour;

															Receives all the new prefixes exceeding the threshold, accepts them and generates a log of the event;

                                Terminates the BGP connection with the neighbor.

                                The Adj-RIB-In stores routing information learned from inbound UPDATE messages that were received from another BGP speaker <xref target="RFC4271">Section 3.2</xref>.
                                The pre-policy limit uses the number of NLRIs per Address Family Identifier (AFI) per Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI) as input into its threshold comparisons.
                                For example, when an operator configures the pre-policy limit for IPv4 Unicast to be 50 on a given EBGP session, and the other BGP speaker announces its 51st IPv4 Unicast NLRI, the session MUST be terminated. 
                            </t>
                            <t>
                                Pre-policy limits are particularly useful to help dampen the effects of full table route leaks and memory exhaustion when the implementation stores rejected routes.
                            </t>
														<t>
															Operators SHOULD take special care when utilizing methods where the router maintains a table of all the received updates pre-policy, as this could still expose control plane to exhaustion if no pre-policy limits are available or are not configured. Implementations SHOULD provide means to configure two thresholds for inbound limits, one before policies are applied, and one after.  This is to prevent exhaustion of control plane resources. The threshold before policy SHOULD be higher than or equal to the limit configured after policy.

                                RFC4271 describes a Policy Information Base (PIB) that contains local policies that can be applied to the information in the Routing Information Base (RIB).
                                The post-policy limit uses the number of NLRIs per Address Family Identifier (AFI) per Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI), after application of the Import Policy as input into its threshold comparisons.
                                For example, when an operator configures the post-policy limit for IPv4 Unicast to be 50 on a given EBGP session, and the other BGP speaker announces a hundred IPv4 Unicast routes of which none are accepted as a result of the local import policy (and thus not considered for the Loc-RIB by the local BGP speaker), the session is not terminated.
                            </t>
                            <t>
                                Post-policy limits are useful to help prevent FIB exhaustion and prevent accidental BGP session teardown due to prefixes not accepted by policy anyway.

                This section records the status of known implementations of the
                protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of
                this Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in

                section is intended to assist the IETF in its decision processes in
                progressing drafts to RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any

                IETF. Furthermore, no effort has been spent to verify the
                information presented here that was supplied by IETF contributors.
                This is not intended as, and must not be construed to be, a catalog
                of available implementations or their features. Readers are advised
